Explanation / Approach

How I Approached the Problem

Breaking Down of the Requirements:

I divided the task into two main components: the backend (FastAPI) and the frontend (Next.js).
The backend handles audio file processing (mocked for simplicity) and provides endpoints for transcription and text-to-speech.
The frontend provides a simple user interface to record audio, upload files, display transcriptions, and play synthesized audio.

Backend:

I used FastAPI for its simplicity and efficiency in building RESTful APIs.
A POST /api/transcribe endpoint accepts audio files and returns a hardcoded transcription in JSON format.
A POST /api/synthesize endpoint simulates text-to-speech and returns a static audio file.
Minimal error handling was added to ensure unsupported file types or missing files are gracefully handled.
Dependencies were managed in a requirements.txt file.

Frontend:

I used Next.js for its powerful framework features, including file-based routing and server-side rendering.
The frontend allows users to:
Record audio using the MediaRecorder API.
Upload the recorded audio to the backend for transcription.
Play back synthesized audio fetched from the backend.
The application state is managed using React's useState hooks for simplicity.

Testing and Integration:

Both components were run locally and integrated to ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

What I Would Do Next if I Had More Time
Enhance the Backend:

Integrate a real speech-to-text (STT) library such as Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper, or SpeechRecognition.
Use a text-to-speech (TTS) library like pyttsx3 or connect to an external service like AWS Polly or Google Text-to-Speech.
Add Database Support:

Implement a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) to persist transcriptions and user data.
Add endpoints for fetching and managing transcription history.
Improve the Frontend:

Display a list of previously transcribed audio files and their corresponding text.
Enhance the UI/UX with better styling, error feedback, and loading indicators.
Add support for file uploads alongside audio recording.
Deploy the Application:

Host the backend using a cloud service like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
Deploy the frontend on platforms like Vercel or Netlify for easy accessibility.
Testing and Validation:

Write unit tests for both frontend and backend components to ensure robustness.
Perform cross-browser testing for compatibility.

For real-world use:
I would consider Whisper for STT due to its high accuracy and open-source nature.
For TTS, I would explore Google TTS or AWS Polly for their reliability and ease of integration.
